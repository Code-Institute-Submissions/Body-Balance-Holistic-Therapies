The aim of this project is to **grow client base locally, in wider areas and by the word of the mouth from the regular clients** where a potential client can go to the website and see the holistic therapists offered. The website would also spread awareness of the benefits of the holistic therapies to the individual's mind, body and soul.

## Demo

## Overview

This website is built as a part of first Milestone project where the client is seeking to gain more customers with their

online presence of the business and to provide more information in relation to the holistic therapies offered by the clinic. By building this project,

I would be able to showcase my coding skills and knowledge of the HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4 and User Centric Frontend Development modules

learnt as part of the Code Instituteâ€™s FullStack Software Development Diploma Course.
