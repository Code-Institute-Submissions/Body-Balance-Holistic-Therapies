                    My name is Renata, and I am an ITEC qualified and accredited therapist and registered with The
                    National Register of Reflexologists of Ireland.
                    <br><br>
                    I have gained qualification and experience of complementary therapies at OBUS School and Wellness 
                    Centre. My therapy treatments include: Holistic and Swedish Massage, Sports Massage, Reflexology, 
                    Reiki, Indian Head Massage, Hot and Cold Stone Massage, Pregnancy Massage, Lymphatic Drain Massage, 
                    Aromatherapy, Ace Cupping therapy, and Ear Candling.
                    <br><br>
                    I was engaged in providing weekly holistic therapies to the elderly people at a residential setting,
                    who were suffering from dementia
                    and brain injuries. These treatments included: Reflexology, Gentle Massage, Head & Hand Massage and
                    Aromatherapy. Through these treatments,
                    I noticed over time that the residents were feeling relaxed and their general wellbeing improved.
                    <br><br>
                    In the age of technology, social media, and data overload, keeping a balance of healthy mind and
                    body is most likely the future of living.
                    Holistic therapies are among the most relaxing and soothing sensations one can experience.

                    <h3>Holistic Massage</h3>
                    <p>
                        The term "holistic" derives from the ancient Greek word "holos," which means "whole." By definition, holistic massage 
                        treats the whole of the body as a single unity. This form of therapy helps by relaxing the muscles, calming the mind, 
                        and rejuvenating the spirit. It is one of the most effective ways to allow the body’s natural healing abilities to come 
                        forth and balance the entire body as a whole. This therapeutic treatment can be adapted to each client’s unique needs, 
                        physical characteristics, and personality.

                    <h3>Reflexology</h3>
                    <p>
                        Reflexology is a therapy that treats the feet in order to balance the whole body. Its main principle is that by massaging 
                        and applying pressure to the reflex areas, other corresponding and connected areas of the body will feel the benefit. The 
                        aim is to stimulate the body’s own healing processes in order to keep it in homeostasis. Reflexology encourages both 
                        relaxation and stimulation: the first helps the body rebuild its energy resources and recover from illness and diseases 
                        whereas the second helps activate the circulation and the nervous system, making both more efficient and thus benefiting 
                        the body as a whole.

                    <h3>Lymphatic Drain Massage</h3>
                    <p>
                        Lymphatic drainage massage is a system of massage techniques that help the lymphatic system to function effectively. 
                        It is a  gentle form of massage that uses superficial, pumping movements on the skin in the direction of the lymph

                    <h3>Aromatherapy</h3>

                        Aromatherapy is a holistic therapy that treats the mind, body, and spirit. It uses essential plant and flower oils 
                        for their therapeutic properties, either in massage, inhalations, or vaporisers. The most common way to use essential 
                        oils is to inhale them, both for their amazing scent and their therapeutic properties. But they can also be used in 
                        diffusers and humidifiers, as well as diluted with a carrier oil and applied to the skin. Essential oils have a wide 
                        range of therapeutic properties which can help to promote healthy sleep, relieve headaches, boost immunity, reduce stress, 
                        support digestion, promote healthy skin and alleviate pain. At Body Balance Holistic Therapies, Aromatherapy can be 
                        incorporated into the full body massage and a home treatment of blended essential oils based on the client’s individual 
                        needs can be provided.

                    <h3>Ace Cupping Therapy</h3>
                    <p>
                        ACE Cupping therapy is a modern form of vacuum therapy by which suction and vacuum pressure is created, which softens 
                        tight muscles and tone attachments, loosen adhesions, and lift connective tissue, bring hydration and blood flow to 
                        body tissues, move deep inflammation to the skin surface for release, and drain excess fluids and toxins by opening 
                        lymphatic pathways. This therapy is incredibly versatile, and the basic movements can easily be customized to 
                        accomplish a wide variety of techniques, from lymphatic drainage to deep tissue release.

                    <h3>Ear Candling</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ear Candling involves placing specialised candle in the ear canal and lightening the opposite end. This is thought to 
                        create a low-level vacuum that draws out ear wax and impurities, reliving pressure in the head and sinuses. Some of the 
                        other proposed benefits of ear candling are relieving sore throats, treating colds and flus, relieving headaches and 
                        migraines, and reducing tension and stress.
