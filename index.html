                        My name is Renata, and I am an ITEC qualified and accredited therapist and registered with

                        I have gained qualification and experience of complementary therapies at OBUS School and
                        Wellness Centre. My therapy treatments include: Holistic and Swedish Massage, Sports Massage,
                        Reflexology, Reiki, Indian Head Massage, Hot and Cold Stone Massage, Pregnancy Massage,
                        Lymphatic Drain Massage, Aromatherapy, Ace Cupping therapy, and Ear Candling.

                        I was engaged in providing weekly holistic therapies to the elderly people at a residential
                        setting, who were suffering from dementia and brain injuries.
                        These treatments included: Reflexology, Gentle Massage, Head & Hand Massage and
                        Aromatherapy. Through these treatments, I noticed over time that the residents were
                        feeling relaxed and their general wellbeing improved.

                        and body is most likely the future of living. Holistic therapies are among the most relaxing

                        <h3>Holistic Massage</h3>
                        <p>
                            The term "holistic" derives from the ancient Greek word "holos," which means "whole." By
                            definition, holistic massage
                            treats the whole of the body as a single unity. This form of therapy helps by relaxing
                            the
                            muscles, calming the mind,
                            and rejuvenating the spirit. It is one of the most effective ways to allow the body’s
                            natural healing abilities to come
                            forth and balance the entire body as a whole. This therapeutic treatment can be adapted
                            to
                            each client’s unique needs,
                            physical characteristics, and personality.

                            Swedish massage is a full body massage therapy which works on the soft tissues and the
                            muscles
                            to restore health by
                            promoting calming and balancing effect on the nervous system. Swedish massage is one of
                            the
                            most
                            commonly offered
                            massage techniques which aims to promote relaxation by releasing muscle tension. Swedish
                            massage
                            can be gentler than
                            deep tissue massage which can be preferred by people interested in relaxation and
                            tension
                            relief.

                        <h3>Reflexology</h3>
                        <p>
                            Reflexology is a therapy that treats the feet in order to balance the whole body. Its
                            main
                            principle is that by massaging
                            and applying pressure to the reflex areas, other corresponding and connected areas of
                            the
                            body
                            will feel the benefit. The
                            aim is to stimulate the body’s own healing processes in order to keep it in homeostasis.
                            Reflexology encourages both
                            relaxation and stimulation: the first helps the body rebuild its energy resources and
                            recover
                            from illness and diseases
                            whereas the second helps activate the circulation and the nervous system, making both
                            more
                            efficient and thus benefiting
                            the body as a whole.

                            absorb and retains heat.

                            pregnant
                            women. The therapy
                            helps to reduce stress hormones, soothe nervous system, and loosen muscles. It can also
                            increase
                            blood flow, which

                            during
                            pregnancy. Prenatal
                            massages are generally considered safe after the first trimester, as long as you get the
                            permission from your general
                            practitioner and you disclose it during the consultation that you’re pregnant.

                        <p>
                            Lymphatic drainage massage is a system of massage techniques that help the lymphatic
                            system
                            to
                            function effectively.
                            It is a gentle form of massage that uses superficial, pumping movements on the skin in
                            the
                            direction of the lymph
                            nodes, the heart and ultimately into the systemic circulation. The lymphatic system
                            plays a
                            vital role in the body

                            to disease and
                            infections. The major benefits are swelling reabsorption, reduced water retention,

                            weight

                            immune system, improved skin texture by reducing swelling, puffiness and blotches,

                            up

                        <p>
                            Ear Candling involves placing specialised candle in the ear canal and lightening the
                            opposite
                            end. This is thought to
                            create a low-level vacuum that draws out ear wax and impurities, reliving pressure in
                            the
                            head
                            and sinuses. Some of the
                            other proposed benefits of ear candling are relieving sore throats, treating colds and
                            flus,
                            relieving headaches and
