                    My name is Renata, and I am an ITEC qualified and accredited therapist and registered with The
                    National Register of Reflexologists of Ireland.
                    <br><br>

                    Centre. My therapy treatments include: Holistic and Swedish Massage, Sports Massage, Reflexology,
                    Reiki, Indian Head Massage, Hot and Cold Stone Massage, Pregnancy Massage, Lymphatic Drain Massage,

                    I was engaged in providing weekly holistic therapies to the elderly people at a residential setting,
                    who were suffering from dementia
                    and brain injuries. These treatments included: Reflexology, Gentle Massage, Head & Hand Massage and
                    Aromatherapy. Through these treatments,
                    I noticed over time that the residents were feeling relaxed and their general wellbeing improved.
                    <br><br>
                    In the age of technology, social media, and data overload, keeping a balance of healthy mind and

                        form with the client focusing
                        on the health history and current symptoms and issues.

                    <h2>Holistic Massage</h2>
                    <p>
                        The term "holistic" derives from the ancient Greek word "holos," which means "whole." By
                        definition, holistic massage
                        treats the whole of the body as a single unity. This form of therapy helps by relaxing the
                        muscles, calming the mind,
                        and rejuvenating the spirit. It is one of the most effective ways to allow the body’s natural
                        healing abilities to come
                        forth and balance the entire body as a whole. This therapeutic treatment can be adapted to each
                        client’s unique needs,
                        physical characteristics, and personality.

                        to restore health by
                        promoting calming and balancing effect on the nervous system. Swedish massage is one of the most
                        commonly offered
                        massage techniques which aims to promote relaxation by releasing muscle tension. Swedish massage
                        can be gentler than
                        deep tissue massage which can be preferred by people interested in relaxation and tension
                        relief.

                    <p>
                        Sports massage is the use of massage for the treatment and prevention of sports massage
                        injuries. It can be used as
                        part of a training program to help prevent injury, as part of rehabilitation program to treat
                        injury, as part of
                        warm-up for an event and as part of the wind-down after the event. Sports massage helps improve
                        the suppleness and
                        flexibility of muscles and joints. It improves lymph and blood circulation and assist body

                    <h2>Reflexology</h2>
                    <p>
                        Reflexology is a therapy that treats the feet in order to balance the whole body. Its main
                        principle is that by massaging
                        and applying pressure to the reflex areas, other corresponding and connected areas of the body
                        will feel the benefit. The
                        aim is to stimulate the body’s own healing processes in order to keep it in homeostasis.
                        Reflexology encourages both
                        relaxation and stimulation: the first helps the body rebuild its energy resources and recover
                        from illness and diseases
                        whereas the second helps activate the circulation and the nervous system, making both more
                        efficient and thus benefiting
                        the body as a whole.

                        with the feet firmly on the ground.

                        from your body. Prenatal massages are adapted for the anatomical changes you go through during
                        pregnancy. Prenatal
                        massages are generally considered safe after the first trimester, as long as you get the
                        permission from your general
                        practitioner and you disclose it during the consultation that you’re pregnant.

                    <h2>Lymphatic Drain Massage</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lymphatic drainage massage is a system of massage techniques that help the lymphatic system to
                        function effectively.
                        It is a gentle form of massage that uses superficial, pumping movements on the skin in the
                        direction of the lymph
                        nodes, the heart and ultimately into the systemic circulation. The lymphatic system plays a
                        vital role in the body
                        by regulating the immune system. Stress and deficient immune systems can make people susceptible
                        to disease and
                        infections. The major benefits are swelling reabsorption, reduced water retention, boosts weight
                        loss, increased
                        immune system, improved skin texture by reducing swelling, puffiness and blotches, speeding up
                        healing scar tissue,
                        reduced cellulite.

                    <h2>Ear Candling</h2>
                    <p>
                        Ear Candling involves placing specialised candle in the ear canal and lightening the opposite
                        end. This is thought to
                        create a low-level vacuum that draws out ear wax and impurities, reliving pressure in the head
                        and sinuses. Some of the
                        other proposed benefits of ear candling are relieving sore throats, treating colds and flus,
                        relieving headaches and
                        migraines, and reducing tension and stress.
